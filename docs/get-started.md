# Get Started

1. Clone this repository and change into the directory.

2. Run the `initial-setup.sh` (for Windows `initial-setup.ps1`) command and
   answer the questions. You can press enter to use the default values it 
   suggest.

   NOTE: On Windows, its a good idea to logout and then back in before 
         proceeding.
3. Now change to the `APPS_DIR` like so: `cd $APPS_DIR`

   NOTE: If this command fails for you, you may need to logout and then log
         back into you account in order for the environment variables that the
         initial-setup command added to your user profile.

5. Run the `start.sh` or `start.ps1` command.

6. Verify that the environment is working on your PC by going to 
   "https://127.0.0.1/" in a web browser. If that loads the default NGinX page
   then you are ready to move on to the next step.

Next, you should review the [Command Reference](command-reference.md) manual.
